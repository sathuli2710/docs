## Problem 1

Using .then() with Promise.resolve()

### Program

```javascript
Promise.resolve("data").then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
console.log("Sync Code"); 
```

### Output

```
Sync Code
data
```

### Explanation

When you use .then(), the JavaScript engine does the following:

1. Register a Callback:

   * .then() attaches a callback function to a Promise.

   * This callback is scheduled to execute when the Promise is resolved.

2. Execution in the Event Loop:

   * Once the Promise resolves, the callback is queued in the microtask queue.

   * The JavaScript engine completes the current call stack, then processes tasks in the microtask queue before moving to the macrotask queue.

## Problem 2

Using await with Promise.resolve()

### Program

```javascript
async function example() {
  console.log("Before await");
  const result = await Promise.resolve("data");
  console.log(result);
}
example();
console.log("Sync Code");
```

### Output

```
Before await
Sync Code
data
```

### Explanation

When the JavaScript engine encounters await:

1. Pause Execution:

   * The await keyword pauses the execution of the function it is in until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

   * The function is split into “before await” and “after await.”

   * I takes the code after await and queue it to the microtask queue(but in a deferred state) which will only be resumed only when the Promise resolves or rejects.

2. Return Control to the Event Loop:

   * While waiting for the Promise, the function’s execution is suspended, and the JavaScript engine moves to the next task in the call stack.

3. Resume Execution:

   * Once the Promise is resolved, the engine schedules the rest of the async function (after await) as a microtask.

   * Execution continues from where it was paused.
