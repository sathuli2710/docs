## Problem 1
Using .then() with Promise.resolve()

### Program

```javascript problem1.js
Promise.resolve("data").then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
console.log("Sync Code"); 
```
### Output

````
Sync Code
data
````
### Explanation

When you use .then(), the JavaScript engine does the following:
	1.	Register a Callback:<br />
        * .then() attaches a callback function to a Promise.
        * This callback is scheduled to execute when the Promise is resolved.
	2.	Execution in the Event Loop:<br />
	    * Once the Promise resolves, the callback is queued in the microtask queue.
	    * The JavaScript engine completes the current call stack, then processes tasks in the microtask queue before moving to the macrotask queue.

## Problem 2
Using await with Promise.resolve()

### Program

```javascript problem2.js
async function example() {
  console.log("Before await");
  const result = await Promise.resolve("data");
  console.log(result);
}
example();
console.log("Sync Code");
```
### Output

````
Before await
Sync Code
data
````
### Explanation

When the JavaScript engine encounters await:
	1.	Pause Execution:<br />
	    * The await keyword pauses the execution of the function it is in until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
	    * The function is split into “before await” and “after await.”
	2.	Return Control to the Event Loop:<br />
	    * While waiting for the Promise, the function’s execution is suspended, and the JavaScript engine moves to the next task in the call stack.
	3.	Resume Execution:<br />
	    * Once the Promise is resolved, the engine schedules the rest of the async function (after await) as a microtask.
	    * Execution continues from where it was paused.
